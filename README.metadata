KHelpCenter documentation meta data structure
=============================================

KHelpCenter uses meta data files which describe the documentation available in
the system. Each document is represented by a meta data file and shown as an
entry in the KHelpCenter navigation tree view. The meta data contains
information about title and short description of the document, the location of
the document and some more information like how to search the document and
translations of title and description. Document hierarchy is represented as
hierarchy of the meta data files. Directories are also described by a meta data
file which contains the same information as a document meta data file.

Format of the meta data files
-----------------------------

The meta files adhere to the Desktop Entry Standard
(http://www.freedesktop.org/Standards/desktop-entry-spec). Documentation
specific extensions are covered by an own namespace using the prefix "X-DOC-".
The following table describes all keys which are currently used by
KHelpCenter:

                                      all schemes which are supported through
                                      kioslaves can be used. In particular the

                                      greater weight indicates that the document
                                      is 'heavier', thus shown below 'lighter'

Meta File Location
------------------

A list of directories given by the config entry "MetaInfoDirs" in the "General"
group of the help center configuration file "khelpcenterrc" (at
$KDEDIRS/share/config) is scanned for desktop files. They are merged to a common
hierarchy. If the "MetaInfoDirs" entry is empty the directory at
$KDEDIRS/share/apps/khelpcenter/plugins is used.

Document Hierarchy
------------------

The hierarchy of the documents shown in the help center is reflected by the
hierarchy of the desktop files in the filesystem. Directories can have an
associated desktop file with the name ".directory". It can contain all the
keys described above.

Language handling
-----------------

In addition to translation of meta information like title and short description
of documents which is contained in the meta file, translations of whole
documents are handled. Each translation of a document has an own desktop file.
The language of the document is indicated by adding the language code as
additional suffix to the the filename of the desktop file. The language suffix
is added before the ".desktop" suffix (Example: 'apache.de.desktop' would be the
file name for the german translation of the apache documentation).

KHelpCenter shows only the documents whose language is contained in the list of
used languages configured for the desktop in the control center. A document
corresponding to a desktop file without language suffix is always shown.
