KInfoBrowser:
-------------

KInfoBrowser is a OpenParts wrapper for the info2html script written
by Karl Guggisberg  <guggis@iam.unibe.ch>. KInfoBrowser is no full featured Part, but
implements the Browser::View interface as defined in kdelibs/corba/idl/browser.idl.
If you need a full featured info-browser part for your application embed khelpcenter which
itself embeds kinfobrowser.
