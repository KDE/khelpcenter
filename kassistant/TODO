how to maintain tons of HTML docs, all linked and rapidly changing? (related topics)

I would add: how do we translate them? We would like to translate them easily,
and to use SGML instead of HTML. Moreover, it would be nice to have nothing
in kdebase/khdelpcenter, and everything in kdebase/doc !
(ebisch@cybercable.tm.fr - doc general coordinator).
 
kassistant/answer/htmlsrch.cpp
-----------------------------------------
1. the extraction of <TITLE> and <META NAME="KEYWORDS" CONTENT=""> are only recogniced
correctly, if the tag (including the corresponding end </TITLE>) is all on the
same line.

wid/highlight.c
---------------------------
may be the widget is on another desktop, or obscured by another window. 

khelp/khelp.h
---------------------------------
put this into kdelibs such that it gets installed in the default kde include dir.
